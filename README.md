# Zorro
Repo for my Zorro lite-c code. 

These scripts run inside the Zorro algorithmic trading platform :

Zorro has some nice ML qualities I would like to point out : 

Machine learning

    Native perceptron and decision tree algorithms.
    Candle pattern analyzer with fuzzy logic algorithm.
    Machine generated algorithms for export in C code.
    Direct access to R packages for analysis and machine learning.
    Deep Learning with Keras/Tensorflow, MxNet, H2O, Deepnet.


My current on the run live project is simply to get started coding it:
